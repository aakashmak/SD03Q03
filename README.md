# SD03Q03
A dataset labelled based on fruit height, width, mass and colour score is given in fruits.xlsx. A classifier based on k Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm is to be crafted for classification.  • Generate scatter plots for various combination of parameters and do the feature engineering meaning thereby which parameters of best suited to build the classifier. • Split the data into test and training split. • Building a classifier using KNN from scratch. • Figure out the best value of k with highest r_score. • Run at least three test cases on the parameter and assess the fruit using the classifier. • Only use python
